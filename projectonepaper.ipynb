    "Car accidents are no trivial matter in the United States. Roughly 800 car accidents occur every day in Illinois alone [@tribune]. Our project is to develop models to both predict and explain a subset of these entirely avoidable accidents in Chicago, Illinois. OpenWeather's historical weather database and the city government of Chicago's website to construct these models and insights. We also obtained the boundaries of the police beats from the city of Chicago's website. These datasets include factors that are widely believed to contribute to higher accident rates, such as weather, time, location, road conditions, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The primary goal of our exploration is to explore useful features for predicting the number of accidents in a given police shift in location clusters called \"police beats\". We hope that the results of our project could be used to further optimize the allocation of first responders across these beats. We believe that the effectiveness of a good prediction algorithm would be measured using one of the many of the many scoring rules described in [@czado]. As of this moment,we find the Dawid-Sebastiani and squared error scores to be the most appealing. \n",

    "Note: We found that the crash data prior to 2017 was infrequently captured, which leads us to not trust it. Therefore, we decided to remove data prior to 2017. This is not really a problem because the vast majority of the data comes after 2017. We will also merge the data sets, which requires us to resample our time series component in the process because the weather data was captured hourly. If we allow for periods of infrequent sampling to sneak in, then it will make us think (possibly incorrectly) that our target is not covariance stationary. "

Given the low counts, these poisson-esque distributions are to be expected; however, they may yet become more informative when we do some feature engineering and look at them from the perspective of rates. The number of units (people, automobiles, etc.) tends to hover around 1-4, which makes a great deal of sense. Given that fact, it makes sense that many of the injury variables tend to hover around 1-2."
